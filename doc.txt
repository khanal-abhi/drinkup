Drinkup Framework Documentation:

All paths are relative to the main hosting path "drinkup.site50.net." This is a temporary hosting account till further development is done.

Actions:

1) user.php:
user.php is used to create a user (after extracting their information from Facebook or letting them create an account with us), search for a user based on the email address, or verify login information. Password reset and email verification will be added shortly, although welcome email is already being sent.

Creating a user:
a) Credentials from the Facebook account.
b) Credentials from a form in the app.

No matter where the credentials are obtained from, make a POST request using the following variables (must supply each and every variable),

type:create,
first:John,
last:Doe,
email:john@doe.com,
age:20,
sex:m,
zip:24060.

you will get one of these responses

'match':'true' -> user exists.
'result':'success' -> user has been created.
'result':'failed' -> possible server error, let's hope for the best and keep me posted if you break it.

Searching for a user:
Search via email only at the moment, but I will be expanding the framework as we go.

type:search
email:john@doe.com

you will get one of the results.
{'match':true, '0':{'first':'John', 'last':'Doe', 'email':'john@doe.com'}, 'results':1} -> remember the pattern as it's consistent. Though unnecessary here, 'results' will tell you the size of the result array.
{'match':false, 'results':0} -> no match found.


2) bar.php:
searching for a bar: (currently just the zip code. I will add Longitude and Lattitude in due time. MYSQL to POSTGRESQL issue with heroku destroyed my work)

type:search
zip:24060

you will get one of there responses

{"match":true,"0":{"id":"8","name":"Big Al\\'s","zip":"24060","icon":"images\/bigals.png"},"1":{"id":"7","name":"Rivermill","zip":"24060","icon":"images\/rivermill.png"},"2":{"id":"6","name":"Sharkeys","zip":"24060","icon":"images\/sharkeys.png"},"results":3} -> same pattern as above
{"match":false,"results":0} -> same here.

I havent used httprequest in androids yet but from what I read, it should be similar. But if my descriptions do not make sense, you can check out the source for 

user.php
bar.php
order.php
menu.php

All of them follow the same pricipal for both requests and responses as well. 
Feel free to email me if you have any question.
